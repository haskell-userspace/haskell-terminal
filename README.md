Haskell terminal emulator
=========================

This is an alpha version of a Haskell terminal emulator. It is both

 1. a library that provides functions to parse VT100 character streams and that
 implements the ANSI terminal actions and
 2. the actual terminal emulator executable (think xterm, gnome-terminal),
 which is currently based on OpenGL.

There is no release yet and this is only a work-in-progress repository. Just you know.
